# Idempotency Handler Payment

Idempotency Handler for Payment & Shopping Operations
This project demonstrates how to effectively handle idempotency for payment processing and shopping-related operations (e.g., "Add to Cart") to ensure that retries do not result in duplicate or inconsistent outcomes.

Key Features:
Idempotent Payment Logic:
In payment processing, ensuring that the same payment is not processed multiple times is crucial. This system prevents duplicate charges by using a unique UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) sent in the request header. If a payment attempt with the same UUID is made within a specific time window, the request is ignored, ensuring that the payment process is not duplicated.

UUID Handling:
We leverage the UUID sent in the header to uniquely identify each transaction. The UUID can be sent from the client-side to maintain consistency across requests, and the system will verify whether a transaction with the same UUID has already been processed.


Why This Approach?
Idempotency: Prevents multiple payments or actions for the same operation, which could lead to errors such as double charges in payment or multiple items added to the cart.
Reliability: The retry mechanism ensures that the system remains responsive even in case of temporary failures.
Scalability: With distributed locking, we ensure that the system can handle high loads while maintaining consistency across multiple instances and services.

How It Works:
The client generates a unique UUID for each transaction or action and sends it in the request header.
On receiving the request, the service checks if a transaction with the same UUID has already been processed (using Redis for quick lookups).
If the transaction is found, the service returns a message indicating that the operation has already been processed.
If the transaction is not found, the service proceeds with the payment or action, stores the result in Redis with the UUID, and applies retry logic in case of failures.
Distributed locking ensures that only one request is processed at a time for a given UUID, even across multiple instances of the service.

Technologies Used:
Spring Boot: For building the backend and handling request/response logic.
Redis: For storing transaction states and managing idempotency checks.
UUID: To uniquely identify each request and prevent duplicate processing.
Distributed Locking (Redisson): To ensure only one transaction is processed at a time in a distributed environment.

Next Steps:
Retry Mechanism: For network errors or transient failures, the system automatically retries the operation, ensuring that the request is eventually successful without duplicating the payment. We have built-in retry logic with exponential backoff to avoid overwhelming the system in case of temporary failures.

Distributed Locking: To ensure concurrency safety, especially in a distributed environment, we implement distributed locking. This prevents multiple service instances from processing the same payment or operation simultaneously, ensuring that each transaction is processed in isolation.

Client-side integration: The system is designed to work with UUIDs sent from the client-side for each transaction, ensuring consistency across different platforms (web, mobile).

Enhanced Error Handling: Improve retry logic with more granular control over the retry policies.

Scalability Improvements: Further optimize the distributed locking mechanism to handle large-scale concurrency scenarios.
